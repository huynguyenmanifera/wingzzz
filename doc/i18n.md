# Translate WingðŸ’¤

For managing translations in Wingzzz, we use [i18n-tasks](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks) and [tolk](https://github.com/tolk/tolk). i18n-tasks was only needed to [normalize](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks#normalize-data) the (all but default) locales. The rest of the process is handled by tolk.

## The translation process

The default locale (`en`) is managed by editing the `*.en.yml` files in the codebase. These can only be edited by developers.

Other locales can be updated through the `/tolk` url on the staging environment. This url is available on the admin panel and thus available for all admin users.

> Currently we think staging the best environment for managing translations. Unreleased labels are most likely to be available here, so translation can be done and merged to the codebase before an actual release is created.

- Synchronize the content of the \*.yml files:

```
  $ heroku run rake tolk:sync --remote staging
  $ heroku run rake tolk:import --remote staging
```

- [Translate](https://wingzzz-staging.herokuapp.com/tolk)
- For every locale (default locale excluded):
- Download https://<span></span>wingzzz-staging.herokuapp.com/tolk/locales/\<locale\>.yaml to config/locales/\<locale>.yml

- Commit, add and push changes.

## Configuration

When the `TOLK_URL` environment variable is defined, the **Translations** link in the admin panel uses this URL to compose the link. This way, an admin user always has access to the correct translations whatever environment the admin is viewing (staging, acceptance, ...).

## Instructions for the translators

To translate:

* Go to [staging](https://wingzzz-staging.herokuapp.com)
* Go to the admin pages by adding "/admin" to the URL in the address bar
* In the sidebar, choose **Translations**
* Click **Hungarian**
* You'll see the message "Some phrases have changed. Update translations". When you click **Update translations**, you will see the labels that need updates.
* Update the content
* Click **Save changes**
* Still in the Hungarian page, click **Phrases missing translation**
* Add the missing translations
* Click **Save changes**
* Inform Kabisa so they can update our codebase with the translations
